          <p>
            In this blog post I'm going to explore some interesting bits of
            mathematics related to series of numbers. The question we begin with
            today is:
            <strong>How long can a series be without repeating?</strong> For
            example, if we choose the numbers 1 to 10, how long can we make a
            series of only those numbers without the series repeating once?
            Before we begin, let me explain what I mean by <em>repeat</em> in
            this case.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this article, a series <strong>repeats</strong> when the same
            number or sequence of numbers appears twice in a row. Here are some
            examples to explain myself better:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>1 2 5 3 <u>7</u> <u>7</u> 6 3</em> is repeating because the
              number 7 appears twice in a row.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>2 3 <u>9 6 5</u> <u>9 6 5</u> 4</em> is also repeating because
              the sequence 9 6 5 repeats twice in a row.
            </li>
            <li>
              Even though the sequence 3 4 9 appears twice in the series
              <em>2 3 4 9 6 3 4 9</em>, it's not repeating because they don't
              appear one right after the other. However, if we added a 6 to the
              end of this series, it would be repeating because of the sequence
              3 4 9 6.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            So, the purpose of this post is to explore how long a series can be
            using a limited amount of numbers (like 1 to 10), without it
            repeating. I'll be calling such series
            <strong>non-repeating series</strong> from now on.

          <p>
            Before we complicate ourselves looking how long we can make
            non-repeating series using 10 numbers, let’s start simple and begin
            at the beginning. The simplest case is if we only allow ourselves
            the number 1: unsurprisingly, the longest series that doesn’t repeat
            with just one number, is, 1.
          </p>
          <p>
            For two numbers, the longest we can get is three long: either 1 2 1
            or 2 1 2 (which are basically the same, only swapping 1 and 2
            round). Here we get stuck because whatever number we add next will
            result in a repeating series (<em>1 2 <u>1</u> <u>1</u></em
            >, <em><u>1 2</u> <u>1 2</u></em
            >).
          </p>
          <p>
            Next in the list, we’ve got series with three numbers. I began
            writing one down on my notebook and it started getting quite longer
            than I had first expected. A lot of the process involved me doing
            guess work, and I easily managed to reach a sequence of 40 numbers
            without repeating. It looked something like this:
            <em>
              1 2 1 3 2 1 2 3 2 1 3 2 3 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 1 2 1 3 1 2 3 1 3 2 3 1 2
              1 3 1 2 3 2 1…
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            At this moment I decided to stop doing it by hand and try let the
            computer calculate for me.

        <article>
          <div>
            <p>
              Here’s the Python code I wrote to find these series. The
              <code>numbers</code>
              list keeps track of our series. What it does is keep adding new
              numbers to the end of the series, and if it is repeating, it’ll
              try another number instead. Because we only add numbers to the
              end, we only need to check if the series is repeating at the end
              every time, and this saves the program time.
            </p>
            <p>
              We keep checking whether the series repeats, and if it does, we
              increase the last number using the
              <code>increase()</code> function. This function will also remove
              the last number if it has gone through all possible options.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use a <code>longest</code> variable to keep the longest series
              of numbers found so far. Every so often we print how many we’ve
              found to show the program's working. Finally, when it goes through
              all the series or we stop the program with Ctrl+C, the program
              will print the series for us.
            </p>
            <p>
              And so I tried it out. In just a few seconds the program had
              already found a series of 1000 numbers that didn’t repeat! I was
              amazed to say the least. And only using the numbers 1, 2 and 3!
              Forget series of 10 numbers! Anyway, I left it for a few minutes
              and it was still going, with 13000 and over. At this point, I
              wondered if it was even possible for this series to go on forever.

          <p>
            Let’s try to figure out if such a series can really be infinite. But
            before we do that for a series with three numbers, we should start
            from the opposite end, that is, with infinitely many numbers. Here
            it’s evident that we can make an infinitely long series without
            repeating, we could do <em>1 2 3 4 5</em> and so on forever. After
            that, we can try a really big finite number like a googol. Surely an
            infinite non-repeating series can be made with a googol numbers? But
            it’s actually a lot trickier to prove than I expected. So before we
            try any further, let’s look take a different approach to the
            problem.

        </header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Here I will show you a way of transforming any series using the
            numbers 1 to 6 that doesn’t repeat, to a series using only 4 numbers
            that is guaranteed not to repeat either. For this example we'll use
            the series <em>3 5 2 4 3 1 6</em>. Here’s a table of numbers: we’ll
            turn every number in the series into the corresponding sequence of
            numbers.
          </p>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Nº</th>
              <th>Sequence</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>1</td>
              <td>123</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>2</td>
              <td>132</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>3</td>
              <td>213</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>4</td>
              <td>231</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>5</td>
              <td>312</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>6</td>
              <td>321</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>
            So the first 3 will turn into the sequence 2 1 3. And doing this
            with all the numbers we get
            <em>2 1 3 + 3 1 2 + 1 3 2 + 2 3 1 + 2 1 3 + 1 2 3 + 3 2 1</em>.
            Then, we put a 4 between every sequence to get
            <em
              >2 1 3 <strong>4</strong> 3 1 2 <strong>4</strong> 1 3 2
              <strong>4</strong> 2 3 1 <strong>4</strong> 2 1 3
              <strong>4</strong> 1 2 3 <strong>4</strong> 3 2 1</em
            >. It can be proved that whatever series of 6 numbers we start with,
            as long as it’s non-repeating, will result in a series of 4 numbers
            that is also non-repeating. Can you figure out why?
          </p>
          <p>
            This means that if there is an infinite non-repeating series with 6
            numbers, there will also be one with 4 numbers. In fact, this isn’t
            unique to just 4 and 6. We just need to assign every number of a
            series to a sequence of other numbers, and put the same number
            between each sequence to create a new series. For example, we can
            transform a series of 120 numbers to one with 6, because there are
            at least 120 sequences using 6 numbers we can make; then working
            backwards we can transform a series of like a googol numbers to one
            with 120, and so on, essentially reaching an infinitely big number.
            This is the beginning of our proof.

          <header>
            <h3>Transforming from 4 to 3</h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            If we try finding a way of transforming a series of 4 numbers to one
            with 3, it’s slightly more complicated. Here’s a method that doesn’t
            work: even though we assign every number to a sequence of 1s and 2s
            and put a 3 between every one, the final result repeats.
          </p>

              <td>21</td>

          <ul>
            <li>3 1 4 3 2 1 3</li>
            <li>1 2 + 1 + 2 1 + 1 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 2</li>
            <li>
              1 2 <strong>3</strong> 1 <strong>3</strong> 2 1

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The sequence <em>1</em> is contained in the sequence
            <em>1 2</em> and this is what allows the repeat. However, there
            actually is a way of doing it that I found, and it’s this: instead
            of putting <em>3</em> between every sequence, we put
            <em><strong>1 2 3</strong></em
            >, and the sequences are different. But they ensure there are no
            repetitions in the final sequence if the starting one isn’t either.

            It may seem a little messy, but it works, which is great.
            <br />
            Now that we’ve got this out of way, let’s finally do some proving.

            Let’s start with a very large number, let’s say a googol plex (it
            doesn’t really matter though). We know that we can transform any
            non-repeating series with a googol plex numbers into one with less
            numbers, and one with even less, and so on, until we reach the
            smallest possible, which is 3. After every step, the resulting
            series gets longer and longer, and so, if we begin again with an
            even bigger number, we know the resulting one will also be bigger.
            Now if we imagine continuing to do this process again and again with
            bigger and bigger numbers forever, all our series will also get
            bigger and bigger forever. That’s basically it! Because we can keep
            going without stopping, the series we make will also keep growing
            forever without limits. That’s the proof that we can make an
            infinite non-repeating series with 3 or more numbers.

            That one day I was bored, playing around with different series of
            numbers, I never imagined it would bring me to discover that a
            series using only 3 numbers can go on forever without repeating (the
            way I defined it). It's been fun, and I hope you've found it
            interesting too. I hope to make more blog posts like this soon.
