			<h1>FAQ</h1>
      <h2>Why qucchia? What does qucchia mean?</h2>
      <p>My internet name is based on the brand named Quechua.
      I just liked the sound of the name and one day, I came up with qucchia.
      Funnily enough, when I first came up with it, I thought it as the name of a community
      or website, not my own personal username.</p>
      <h2>How do you pronounce qucchia?</h2>
      <p><em>You</em> can pronounce qucchia however you like, but if you want to know how I do,
      a while ago I found the exact phonetic transcription of how I pronounce it, and plugged it
      into <a href="http://ipa-reader.xyz/" target="_blank">http://ipa-reader.xyz/</a>. I can't
      remember the transcription now, but I do still have the audio file:</p>
      <audio controls>
        <source src="qucchia.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"></source>
        Your browser doesn't support the audio tag.
      </audio>
      <h2>Why doesn't qucchia start with an uppercase Q?</h2>
      <p>When I first created an account called qucchia, which was on Scratch, I accidentally made
        the q lowercase while I had been planning to make it uppercase. Since then, to stay consistent
        I suppose to my original name, I always try to make my username all lowercase. I won't complain
        if someone calls me "Qucchia", but I'll still consider it incorrect.
