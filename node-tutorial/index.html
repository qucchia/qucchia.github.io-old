			<h1>Node Tutorial</h1>
			<section>
				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>In this tutorial I will introduce NodeJS and begin a simple project,
					connecting to a Scratch project via cloud variables. It's intended for any Scratcher, beginner
					or expert, and I've tried to make it easy to understand for everyone.</p>
				<h3>What is NodeJS?</h3>
				<p>NodeJS is basically an environment for running the programming language JavaScript (that's what the JS stands for).
					Node is usually used for what is called <strong>backend</strong>, that is, a server that users can communicate
					with. For our applications, we can use Node to connect our Scratch projects to websites, allow them to store data
					online, and more. 
				</p>
				<h3>What you need to know</h3>
				<p>For this tutorial all you should know is Scratch and at least a little of how cloud variables work.
					Knowing JavaScript also helps, but is not necessary.

				<h2>Getting started</h2>
				<h3>Creating a repl</h3>
				<p>It can be a good idea to install NodeJS on your computer and a code editor, but we're just trying it out
					so we'll use the online environment <a href="https://repl.it" target="_blank">repl.it</a>.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Open the link and create an account on repl.it or sign in.</li>
					<li>Click the + button which may appear on the top right of the page to create a new repl.
						Select <strong>Node.js</strong> as the repl type, and give it a name.
						<br/>

					</li>
					<li>Click <strong>Create repl</strong>.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Your first program</h3>
				<img src="repl editor.png" alt="Screenshot of repl.it editor"/>
				<p>This is the repl.it editor. All you need to know for now is that the section in the middle is where you'll
					write the code, and the black section on the right is where you will get all the output when the program is run.
				Enter the code <code>console.log("Hello, World!");</code> as shown above and click the <strong>Run</strong> button
				at the top. You should see at the right (called the console) appear the message <code>Hello, World!</code>
				<h4>How it works</h4>
				<p><code>console.log</code> is a JavaScript function (like a block in Scratch). It prints something to the console,
					and the inputs you give it between the brackets is what is printed. Every command in JavaScript ends in a semicolon.</p>
