			<h1>A Curious Case</h1>
			<p>This is a short story I have written. Enjoy!</p>
			<p id="story">Before the front door of an elegant mansion, a man dressed in a colour so dull no one has bothered remembering (since his golden monocle was far more attention-attracting), pulled a bell and, a few moments later, a girl opened the door. Without asking who he was she admitted him and turned to run.
				<br>‘Daddy, come! It’s Inspector Falise!’ she cried. ‘And you, Spots, get up for once!’
				<br>The man who in effect was Inspector Falise hung up his dull coat and his hat (which happened to be dull as well), and advanced to the living room with his observant and methodical gaze through his monocle, which always seemed to be collecting all the details little as they may be. For a little time he maintained a staring contest with a white cat sprinkled black, who was probably Spots. Stretched on its bed, it seemed the laziest cat in the world. Suddenly another man appeared, tall, blonde and dangerously skinny, wearing a lopsided frock coat. The inspector was forced to admit victory to the cat.
				<br>‘Mr. Falise, eternally grateful that you decided to pay a visit,’ said the man, while he put his coat on right. ‘If you agree, I’ll show you the scene of the crime.’
				<br>‘There’s no time to lose,’ came his response.
				<br>The inspector followed the other man, whose name he couldn’t even bring to mind since the morning, into a small storage room. The door had a keyhole and a cat flap, and the room was full of both human and cat food. A small round table held an ornamented silver box.
				<br>‘The necklace was right here, sir,’ the man opened the silver box and wavered a finger at it. ‘As you can see, the door was locked, and I’ve had the only key for it in my pocket all this time.’
				<br>‘Very well,’ said the detective thoughtfully, beginning to look around the room. ‘I have two questions for now, sir. In the first place, who knew, or who do you know knew, that a diamond necklace of great value was in your possession?’
				<br>‘This is where I get stuck, sir. For all I know, not a single soul (other than me, of course) knew of the existence of the necklace here. I was keeping it for my wife’s birthday, which is in three days. To keep it a surprise for everyone as well as her, I didn’t tell anyone.’
				<br>‘I’m sure, sir, that at least the soul belonging to whoever sold you this valuable would know of you having it, but never mind that, because I think I have another lead,’ During the conversation, the inspector had been lifting up and opening boxes, checking marks on the walls, and even sniffing the surfaces. ‘My second question is this: has there been a moment in which you left the door to this room open?’
				<br>‘I am completely certain, sir, that the answer to that question is no. The necklace was in the box when I locked the room yesterday evening, and when I opened it this morning it was gone!’
				<br>‘Thank you, sir. All you have said is probably true, and even otherwise, I don’t think it would affect my conclusion to this curious case.’ The inspector spoke these words with a very subtle change in tone, not as dull and monotonous as before. He got up from inspecting the table and looked directly at the other man whose name he could not recall. He looked as if some of the wrinkles on his forehead had moved to his cheeks, and his eyes had a twinkle in them that was quite hard to find in figures like the great Falise. ‘Sir, no one has entered nor left the room since yesterday evening, but the necklace is not here. Do you know how this is possible? Mr. Eriksson, is it possible that the necklace happens to smell of fish?’
				<br>This question, so sudden and unexpected, took Mr. Eriksson, the name of which the inspector had finally remembered in his inspiration, completely off his feet. His eyes wide open, he turned his head slowly at the cat flap in the door, and turned his astounded gaze back to the inspector. The latter had his eyebrows raised and his head very slightly inclined forward.
				<br>‘Inspector Falise, you’re a genius!’ exclaimed Eriksson. ‘As your brilliant mind has probably guessed, I dropped the precious necklace in a bag of our cat food yesterday, and hadn’t been able to get the fishy smell off it. My word! My daughter’s been bothering me all morning about how Spots hasn’t been feeling well today, but maybe he doesn’t want to get up from his bed…’
				<br>‘Indeed, Mr. Eriksson. Because he’s lying on the necklace.’
				<br>They both started to laugh like madmen, suddenly and uncontrollably. Before he sunk into the never-ending sea of laughter once more, the inspector calmed down to make one final comment.
				<br>‘This was just the remedy I needed after what I’ve been through in my latest adventures! I mean it from the bottom of my heart, Mr. Eriksson, when I say: thank you for dropping your necklace in Spots’ food!’
